# Simple-Calculator
Welcome to my first program written in Bash Scripts. This is a Simple Calculator, which allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To use the Simple Calculator, run the script on a system with the Bash shell installed.
<h2>Operations</h2>

The program supports the following operations:

<ol>
  <li>Addition</li>
  <li>Subtraction</li>
  <li>Multiplication</li>
  <li>Division</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inputs</h2>

The user will be prompted to enter two numbers and the operation they wish to perform. The program will then perform the selected operation and display the result.

<h2>Error Handling</h2>
The program includes error handling for division by zero, where it will display a message indicating that the operation cannot be performed.

<h2><em>Conclusion</em></h2>
<em>This Simple Calculator program provides a basic example of using the Bash scripting language to perform arithmetic operations. The program can be further improved and extended to include additional features and functions.</em>
